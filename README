Ooblik's Kinect Mouse - By Tim Flaman - tim@timflaman.com
=========================================================

This is a demo program to allow the control of the mouse by Microsoft's 
Kinect sensor. This will not work unless you have compiled and installed
the Freenect drivers located at https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect

Based off of the Freenect example from the OpenKinect Project.

Probably has to be run as root...

Required Libraries:
 -- libfreenect
 -- libx11-dev
 -- libxtst-dev
 -- freeglut3-dev
 -- libxmu-dev

To build: 

 - Open Terminal and navigate to kinect_mouse dir
 - mkdir build
 - cd build
 - cmake ..
 - make
